All the people in his house, for example, had to shut the door behind them when they came into the room or left it. One day a maid servant came and asked him to let her visit her sister who lived ten miles away. Swift not only agreed, but let her go there in his own carriage. The girl was so happy that she forgot to shut the door when she left the room. Swift let her go, but about half an hour later he ordered one of the servant to ride after the carriage and tell the girl come back. The poor girl had to turn back. She asked him what he wanted. I only want you to shut the door, was his answer. Now you may go to visit your sister. I wish you a pleasant journey. Why did J.

When he was a small boy he was asked to play at a home party at their friends\u2019 place. Though he was only eight he was quite experienced in playing the piano and did it well. At that concert he was to play one of Beethoven\u2019s sonatas. It must be mentioned that there are several very long intervals in that sonata. In each of these intervals the boy took his hands off the keyboard and waited.

When the ice-breakers arrive everyone knows that spring will soon come and that long Canadian winter is almost over. The slow movement of the ice-breaking ships up the river to Montreal is reported over the radio and in the newspapers. Whole families go on Sunday excursions to the river bank where they spend hours watching the ship at work. In March many ships gather in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, waiting for the signal telling them that the way to Montreal is free. As soon as the signal is given, a race begins for the port. The winning ship is given a great welcome, and the captain receives a special prize. \u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: The arrival of the ice-breakers means that ...","reply1":"... you can go on an excursion to the river bank.","reply2":"... it is reported over the radio.","reply3":"... people can walk along the river.","reply4":"... the captains will receive good prizes.","reply5":"... the long winter is almost over.","reply6":null,"reply7":null,"reply8":null,"correctly":"5","selected":""},{"id_theme":"111","theme":"\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a","statya":"","question":"\u041e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0444\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044e \u0438\u043d\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0443\u044e\u0449\u0435\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438: Arman was the first to recover.","reply1":"\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e","reply2":"\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435","reply3":"\u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435","reply4":"\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0435","reply5":"\u043f\u043e\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0449\u0435\u0435","reply6":null,"reply7":null,"reply8":null,"correctly":"2","selected":""},{"id_theme":"111","theme":"\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a","statya":"","question":"\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435: In Kazakhstan there is only one lake \u2026 I haven\u2019t visited yet.","reply1":"Whose.","reply2":"What.","reply3":"Which.","reply4":"Whom.","reply5":"Who.","reply6":null,"reply7":null,"reply8":null,"correctly":"3","selected":""},{"id_theme":"111","theme":"\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a","statya":"","question":"\u0412\u044b\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e.
